# 🤖✨ Generative AI Projects for Healthcare  
Welcome to my playground of projects exploring the power of **Generative AI** — with a strong focus on **Healthcare applications** 🏥🧠💡

---

## 🚀 What You'll Find Here

This repository is a growing collection of experiments, prototypes, and research explorations around **GenAI**, including:

- 🧬 **Clinical Text Generation** – using LLMs for summarizing, expanding, and translating medical records
- 🧠 **Patient-Centric Language Models** – tailored for healthcare dialogue and education
- 🧾 **Synthetic Medical Data Generation** – privacy-preserving data for model training
- 🔍 **Graph-Aware LLMs** – combining Neo4j and language models for healthcare knowledge graphs
- 🧪 **Few-Shot & Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** – in low-data clinical scenarios

> ✨ All code is written with **research**, **experimentation**, and **real-world healthcare use cases** in mind.

## 🎯 Motivation

Healthcare data is complex, sensitive, and critically important. I believe **Generative AI** can play a key role in:

- Enhancing **clinical decision support**
- Empowering **patients** through better education
- Accelerating **medical research** with synthetic data and smart summarization
- Bridging the gap between **unstructured data** and actionable insights
